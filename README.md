# Tkinter Basic Python Analog Clock

## Description

This is a simple analog clock created using Python's Tkinter library. The clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands. Insanely easy, did it cuz i'm severely depressed and i can't handle working on serious projects.

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- Tkinter library (Usually comes pre-installed with Python, if you don't have it, idk what to tell ya man)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tkinter-analog-clock.git
   ```

## Uh, that's it. It's a clock. It can uhh... yeah, tell you what time is it.
